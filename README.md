# Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity
A curated list of my paper reading on artificial intelligence in cybersecurity

This is the curated list of research papers that I read. I will updating the list of papers I read every week.

Columns `Topic/Keyword` and `Summary` are subjective according to me, so they may not fully reflect the content of the respective paper.

What's the purpose of reading research papers?
- Gain familiarity with the subject and keep updated with the progressive nature of science and technology.
- To prepare myself for PhD.
- To be a better researcher.
